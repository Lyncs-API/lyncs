A python API for lattice QCD applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lyncs is a Python API for Lattice QCD applications currently under development with a first
released version expected by the end of Q2 of 2020. Lyncs aims to bring several popular
libraries for Lattice QCD under a common framework. Lyncs will interface with libraries for
GPUs and CPUs in a way that can accommodate additional computing architectures as these
arise, achieving the best performance for the calculations while maintaining the same high-
level workflow. Lyncs is one of 10 applications supported by PRACE-6IP, WP8 "Forward
Looking Software Solutions".
